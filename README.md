## Overview

This project uses a number of interactive visualizations to help us analyze the data. Our data comes from two data sets, and we need to preprocess and analyze them. We used seaborn and matplotlib to help us complete the visualization. At the same time, we also constructed a linear regression model. Ultimately, we identified three important factors that influence sleep.
