# ðŸŽˆ Sleep and Health APP

This is a app that analyzes and predict between factors affecting sleep quality and health.
We will eventually learn which factors affect sleep quality.
And we allow users to predict their sleep quality by inputting their actual conditions.

## Overview

This project uses a number of interactive visualizations to help us analyze the data. Our data comes from two data sets, and we need to preprocess and analyze them. We used seaborn and matplotlib to help us complete the visualization. At the same time, we also constructed three model. Ultimately, we identified three important factors that influence sleep.
Afterwards, we created a software that allows users to predict their own sleep quality.
